- Learning Curves (all models)
- Decision Tree Structure (tree models)
- Feature Importance (tree models)
- Decision Boundary (all models)

---

## 🎯 **How to Use New Features:**

### **Upload Custom Dataset:**
1. Look for "Upload Custom Dataset" section in sidebar
2. Drag & drop your CSV file OR click to browse
3. Format: Features in columns, target in last column
4. First 2 features will be used for 2D visualization

### **View Confusion Matrix:**
1. Select any classification algorithm
2. Click "Run Analysis"
3. Scroll down to see confusion matrix heatmap
4. Shows prediction accuracy breakdown

### **View Learning Curves:**
1. Run any model
2. Scroll down to see learning curves
3. Green line = Training score
4. Blue line = Validation score
5. Helps identify overfitting

### **Export Results:**
1. After running analysis
2. Click "Export Results" button (top right)
3. Downloads JSON file with all data
4. Includes metrics, predictions, visualizations

---

## 📊 **What Each Visualization Shows:**

### **Decision Boundary**
- How the model separates classes
- 2D visualization of decision regions
- Data points overlaid

### **Confusion Matrix**
- Prediction accuracy breakdown
- Rows = Actual classes
- Columns = Predicted classes
- Diagonal = Correct predictions

### **Learning Curves**
- Model performance vs training size
- Training score (green)
- Validation score (blue)
- Gap indicates overfitting

### **Feature Importance**
- Which features matter most
- Only for tree-based models
- Bar chart showing importance values

### **Decision Tree Structure**
- Visual tree diagram
- Blue boxes = Decision nodes
- Green boxes = Leaf nodes
- Shows split conditions

---

## 🧪 **Test the New Features:**

### **Test 1: New Datasets**
```
